# Canopy-CCGR
This Matlab code segments the canopy images into the vegetation and background (soil) parts. It returns the number of pixels, mean values, and variances of R, G, and B colors in each segment, separately (RGB color system). Moreover, the code calculates the vegetation indices of CC, GR, and CCGR.
